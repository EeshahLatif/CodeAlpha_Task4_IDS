# CodeAlpha Task 4 - Network Intrusion Detection System (IDS)

## ðŸ“Œ Overview
This is my fourth project for the CodeAlpha Cyber Security Internship.  
It demonstrates basic IDS concepts with:

1. A **Snort rule** to detect ICMP pings (`local.rules`).  
2. A **Python IDS demo** that runs locally and prints alerts (`python_ids_demo.py`).  
3. Setup instructions for Snort in `IDS_SETUP.md`.  
4. Demo screenshot(s) in the `screenshots/` folder.

## ðŸ“‚ Files in this repository
- `README.md` â€” this file  
- `IDS_SETUP.md` â€” Snort installation & run instructions (Ubuntu example)  
- `local.rules` â€” Snort rule to detect ICMP ping  
- `python_ids_demo.py` â€” Python IDS simulation (runs locally)  
- `run_demo_instructions.txt` â€” how to run the Python demo and capture screenshot  
- `REPORT.md` â€” short explanation of what was done and why  
- `snort_config_example.txt` â€” optional snippet to include local.rules in snort.conf  
- `screenshots/` â€” folder for demo screenshot(s) (upload `demo_alert.png` here)

## ðŸŽ¯ Purpose
- Demonstrate ability to write IDS rules (Snort).  
- Provide a runnable demo for reviewers who cannot install Snort (Python simulation).  
- Provide clear documentation so a reviewer or mentor can reproduce or understand the setup.

## âœ… Submission Checklist
- Repo is public and named `CodeAlpha_Task4_IDS`.  
- All files above are uploaded.  
- `screenshots/demo_alert.png` uploaded (after running demo).  
- LinkedIn video with repo link posted and submission form filled in the internship WhatsApp group.
